My name is Bashar Altaleb and I am 27 years old, single, and don't have children yet. I come originally from Syria, born and raised in Damascus "The capital city in Syria", but I have moved to Sweden in September 2015. At first, I lived in a little city called Avesta in Dalarna province, but in 2018 I moved to Sundbyberg, Stockholm.</br>
</br>
In my free time, I got used to following my interests and hobbies. I always spend my time on instructive things like Swedish and English linguistic studies. Furthermore, I like to play guitar, read books, cook food, exercise at the gym, learn to program, and visit my friends to have a good time with them. In the future, I hope that I can start my own business that can to a certain extent relate to programming and IT section.</br>
</br>
During the period I have spent in Sweden, I have worked at a danish furniture store called BoConcept. My work duties varied between assembly, deliveries, and warehouse work. Before the before mentioned occupation, I have worked for Hyresgästföreningen as Arabic-Swedish interpreter, and at a primary school as a resource educator and fritids staff. In Syria, I had worked with mobile phone accessories business. Well, I also have worked for a while at a restaurant as a cash desk clerk and that happened in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</br>
</br>
When it comes to my educational background, in 2011, I started studying Mathematics at Damascus University, Syria. Unfortunately, I couldn't complete the fourth and last year at this program. In 2013, I took the initiative to be a volunteer at The Syrian Red Crescent for a month or so.</br>
</br>
Arabic is my mother language. I also can speak English as a second language, and of course Swedish as a second language. Additionally, I have obtained the Swedish B Driving License, and I do have the International Computer Driving License (ICDL).
